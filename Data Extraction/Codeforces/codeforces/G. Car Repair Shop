Tomorrow will be the first working day of his car repair shop. For now the car repair shop is very small and only one car can be repaired at a given time.\u000aPolycarp is good at marketing, so he has already collected n requests from clients. The requests are numbered from 1 to n in order they came.\u000aThe i-th request is characterized by two values: si \u2014 the day when a client wants to start the repair of his car, di \u2014 duration (in days) to repair the car. The days are enumerated from 1, the first day is tomorrow, the second day is the day after tomorrow and so on.\u000aPolycarp is making schedule by processing requests in the order from the first to the n-th request. He schedules the i-th request as follows:\u000aIf the car repair shop is idle for di days starting from si (si,\u2009si\u2009+\u20091,\u2009...,\u2009si\u2009+\u2009di\u2009-\u20091), then these days are used to repair a car of the i-th client.\u000aOtherwise, Polycarp finds the first day x (from 1 and further) that there are di subsequent days when no repair is scheduled starting from x. In other words he chooses the smallest positive x that all days x,\u2009x\u2009+\u20091,\u2009...,\u2009x\u2009+\u2009di\u2009-\u20091 are not scheduled for repair of any car. So, the car of the i-th client will be repaired in the range [x,\u2009x\u2009+\u2009di\u2009-\u20091]. It is possible that the day x when repair is scheduled to start will be less than si.\u000aGiven n requests, you are asked to help Polycarp schedule all of them according to the rules above.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009200) \u2014 the number of requests from clients.\u000aThe following n lines contain requests, one request per line.
