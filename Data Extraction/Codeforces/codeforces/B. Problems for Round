VB. Problems for Round\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aThere are n problems prepared for the next Codeforces round. They are arranged in ascending order by their difficulty, and no two problems have the same difficulty. Moreover, there are m pairs of similar problems. Authors want to split problems between two division according to the following rules:\u000aProblemset of each division should be non-empty.\u000aEach problem should be used in exactly one division (yes, it is unusual requirement).\u000aEach problem used in division 1 should be harder than any problem used in division 2.\u000aIf two problems are similar, they should be used in different divisions.\u000aYour goal is count the number of ways to split problem between two divisions and satisfy all the rules. Two ways to split problems are considered to be different if there is at least one problem that belongs to division 1 in one of them and to division 2 in the other.\u000aNote, that the relation of similarity is not transitive. That is, if problem i is similar to problem j and problem j is similar to problem k, it doesn't follow that i is similar to k.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000, 0\u2009\u2264\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of problems prepared for the round and the number of pairs of similar problems, respectively.\u000aEach of the following m lines contains a pair of similar problems ui and vi (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ui,\u2009vi\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009ui\u2009\u2260\u2009vi). It's guaranteed, that no pair of problems meets twice in the input.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint one integer \u2014 the number of ways to split problems in two divisions.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a5 2\u000a1 4\u000a5 2\u000aoutput\u000a2\u000ainput\u000a3 3\u000a1 2\u000a2 3\u000a1 3\u000aoutput\u000a0\u000ainput\u000a3 2\u000a3 1\u000a3 2\u000aoutput\u000a1\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample, problems 1 and 2 should be used in division 2, while problems 4 and 5 in division 1. Problem 3 may be used either in division 1 or in division 2.\u000aIn the second sample, all pairs of problems are similar and there is no way to split problem between two divisions without breaking any rules.\u000aThird sample reminds you that the similarity relation is not transitive. Problem 3 is similar to both 1 and 2, but 1 is not similar to 2, so they may be used together.
