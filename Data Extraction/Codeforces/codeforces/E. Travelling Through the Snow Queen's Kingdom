Travelling Through the Snow Queen's Kingdom\u000atime limit per test1.5 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aGerda is travelling to the palace of the Snow Queen.\u000aThe road network consists of n intersections and m bidirectional roads. Roads are numbered from 1 to m. Snow Queen put a powerful spell on the roads to change the weather conditions there. Now, if Gerda steps on the road i at the moment of time less or equal to i, she will leave the road exactly at the moment i. In case she steps on the road i at the moment of time greater than i, she stays there forever.\u000aGerda starts at the moment of time l at the intersection number s and goes to the palace of the Snow Queen, located at the intersection number t. Moreover, she has to be there at the moment r (or earlier), before the arrival of the Queen.\u000aGiven the description of the road network, determine for q queries li, ri, si and ti if it's possible for Gerda to get to the palace on time.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains integers n, m and q (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u20091000, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009m,\u2009q\u2009\u2264\u2009200\u2009000) \u2014 the number of intersections in the road network of Snow Queen's Kingdom, the number of roads and the number of queries you have to answer.\u000aThe i-th of the following m lines contains the description of the road number i.

It's possible to get both from vi to ui and from ui to vi using only this road. Each pair of intersection may appear several times, meaning there are several roads connecting this pair.\u000aLast q lines contain the queries descriptions.
