Dexterina\u2019s Lab\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aDexterina and Womandark have been arch-rivals since they\u2019ve known each other. Since both are super-intelligent teenage girls, they\u2019ve always been trying to solve their disputes in a peaceful and nonviolent way. After god knows how many different challenges they\u2019ve given to one another, their score is equal and they\u2019re both desperately trying to best the other in various games of wits. This time, Dexterina challenged Womandark to a game of Nim.\u000aNim is a two-player game in which players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects from a single heap. The player who can't make a turn loses. By their agreement, the sizes of piles are selected randomly from the range [0,\u2009x]. Each pile's size is taken independently from the same probability distribution that is known before the start of the game.\u000aWomandark is coming up with a brand new and evil idea on how to thwart Dexterina\u2019s plans, so she hasn\u2019t got much spare time. She, however, offered you some tips on looking fabulous in exchange for helping her win in Nim.
