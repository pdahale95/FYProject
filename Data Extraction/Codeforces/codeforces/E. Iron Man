He lives in Malibu. Malibu has n junctions numbered from 1 to n, connected with n\u2009-\u20091 roads. One can get from a junction to any other junction using these roads (graph of Malibu forms a tree).\u000aTony has m suits. There's a special plan for each suit. The i-th suit will appear at the moment of time ti in the junction vi, and will move to junction ui using the shortest path between vi and ui with the speed ci roads per second (passing a junctions takes no time), and vanishing immediately when arriving at ui (if it reaches ui in time q, it's available there at moment q, but not in further moments). Also, suits move continuously (for example if vi\u2009\u2260\u2009ui, at time it's in the middle of a road. Please note that if vi\u2009=\u2009ui it means the suit will be at junction number vi only at moment ti and then it vanishes.\u000aAn explosion happens if at any moment of time two suits share the same exact location (it may be in a junction or somewhere on a road; while appearing, vanishing or moving).\u000aYour task is to tell Tony the moment of the the first explosion (if there will be any).\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of junctions and the number of suits respectively.\u000aThe next n\u2009-\u20091 lines contain the roads descriptions.
