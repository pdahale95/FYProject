They're all uncolored. There are n shields in total, the i-th shield is located at point (xi,\u2009yi) of the coordinate plane. It's possible that two or more shields share the same location.\u000aSteve wants to paint all these shields. He paints each shield in either red or blue. Painting a shield in red costs r dollars while painting it in blue costs b dollars.\u000aAdditionally, there are m constraints Steve wants to be satisfied. The i-th constraint is provided by three integers ti, li and di:\u000aIf ti\u2009=\u20091, then the absolute difference between the number of red and blue shields on line x\u2009=\u2009li should not exceed di.\u000aIf ti\u2009=\u20092, then the absolute difference between the number of red and blue shields on line y\u2009=\u2009li should not exceed di.\u000aSteve gave you the task of finding the painting that satisfies all the condition and the total cost is minimum.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of shields and the number of constraints respectively.\u000aThe second line contains two integers r and b (1\u2009\u2264\u2009r,\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u2009109).\u000aThe next n lines contain the shields coordinates.

The i-th character should be 'r' if the i-th shield should be painted red in the optimal answer and 'b' if it should be painted blue.
