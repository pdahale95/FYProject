As a gift Loki gave him a smartphone. There are n applications on this phone. Thor is fascinated by this phone. He has only one minor issue: he can't count the number of unread notifications generated by those applications (maybe Loki put a curse on it so he can't).\u000aq events are about to happen (in chronological order). They are of three types:\u000aApplication x generates a notification (this new notification is unread).\u000aThor reads all notifications generated so far by application x (he may re-read some notifications).\u000aThor reads the first t notifications generated by phone applications (notifications generated in first t events of the first type). It's guaranteed that there were at least t events of the first type before this event. Please note that he doesn't read first t unread notifications, he just reads the very first t notifications generated on his phone and he may re-read some of them in this operation.\u000aPlease help Thor and tell him the number of unread notifications after each event.
