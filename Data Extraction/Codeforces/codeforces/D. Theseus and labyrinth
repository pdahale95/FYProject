VD. Theseus and labyrinth\u000atime limit per test3 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aTheseus has just arrived to Crete to fight Minotaur. He found a labyrinth that has a form of a rectangular field of size n\u2009×\u2009m and consists of blocks of size 1\u2009×\u20091.\u000aEach block of the labyrinth has a button that rotates all blocks 90 degrees clockwise. Each block rotates around its center and doesn't change its position in the labyrinth. Also, each block has some number of doors (possibly none). In one minute, Theseus can either push the button in order to rotate all the blocks 90 degrees clockwise or pass to the neighbouring block. Theseus can go from block A to some neighbouring block B only if block A has a door that leads to block B and block B has a door that leads to block A.\u000aTheseus found an entrance to labyrinth and is now located in block (xT,\u2009yT) \u2014 the block in the row xT and column yT. Theseus know that the Minotaur is hiding in block (xM,\u2009yM) and wants to know the minimum number of minutes required to get there.\u000aTheseus is a hero, not a programmer, so he asks you to help him.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u20091000) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns in labyrinth, respectively.\u000aEach of the following n lines contains m characters, describing the blocks of the labyrinth. The possible characters are:\u000a«+» means this block has 4 doors (one door to each neighbouring block);\u000a«-» means this block has 2 doors \u2014 to the left and to the right neighbours;\u000a«|» means this block has 2 doors \u2014 to the top and to the bottom neighbours;\u000a«^» means this block has 1 door \u2014 to the top neighbour;\u000a«>» means this block has 1 door \u2014 to the right neighbour;\u000a«<» means this block has 1 door \u2014 to the left neighbour;\u000a«v» means this block has 1 door \u2014 to the bottom neighbour;\u000a«L» means this block has 3 doors \u2014 to all neighbours except left one;\u000a«R» means this block has 3 doors \u2014 to all neighbours except right one;\u000a«U» means this block has 3 doors \u2014 to all neighbours except top one;\u000a«D» means this block has 3 doors \u2014 to all neighbours except bottom one;\u000a«*» means this block is a wall and has no doors.\u000aLeft, right, top and bottom are defined from representing labyrinth as a table, where rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right.\u000aNext line contains two integers \u2014 coordinates of the block (xT,\u2009yT) (1\u2009\u2264\u2009xT\u2009\u2264\u2009n, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009yT\u2009\u2264\u2009m), where Theseus is initially located.\u000aLast line contains two integers \u2014 coordinates of the block (xM,\u2009yM) (1\u2009\u2264\u2009xM\u2009\u2264\u2009n, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009yM\u2009\u2264\u2009m), where Minotaur hides.\u000aIt's guaranteed that both the block where Theseus starts and the block where Minotaur is hiding have at least one door. Theseus and Minotaur may be initially located at the same block.\u000aOutput\u000aIf Theseus is not able to get to Minotaur, then print -1 in the only line of the output.
