Brain Network (easy)\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aOne particularly well-known fact about zombies is that they move and think terribly slowly. While we still don't know why their movements are so sluggish, the problem of laggy thinking has been recently resolved. It turns out that the reason is not (as previously suspected) any kind of brain defect \u2013 it's the opposite! Independent researchers confirmed that the nervous system of a zombie is highly complicated \u2013 it consists of n brains (much like a cow has several stomachs). They are interconnected by brain connectors, which are veins capable of transmitting thoughts between brains. There are two important properties such a brain network should have to function properly:\u000aIt should be possible to exchange thoughts between any two pairs of brains (perhaps indirectly, through other brains).\u000aThere should be no redundant brain connectors, that is, removing any brain connector would make property 1 false.\u000aIf both properties are satisfied, we say that the nervous system is valid. Unfortunately (?), if the system is not valid, the zombie stops thinking and becomes (even more) dead. Your task is to analyze a given nervous system of a zombie and find out whether it is valid.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u20091000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to n) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively.
