USC has n cities numbered from 1 through n and n\u2009-\u20091 roads between them. Cities and roads of USC form a rooted tree (Barney's not sure why it is rooted). Root of the tree is the city number 1. Thus if one will start his journey from city 1, he can visit any city he wants by following roads.\u000aSome girl has stolen Barney's heart, and Barney wants to find her. He starts looking for in the root of the tree and (since he is Barney Stinson not a random guy), he uses a random DFS to search in the cities. A pseudo code of this algorithm is as follows:\u000a\u000alet starting_time be an array of length n\u000acurrent_time = 0\u000adfs(v):\u000a current_time = current_time + 1\u000a starting_time[v] = current_time\u000a shuffle children[v] randomly (each permutation with equal possibility)\u000a // children[v] is vector of children cities of city v\u000a for u in children[v]:\u000a  dfs(u)\u000aAs told before, Barney will start his journey in the root of the tree (equivalent to call dfs(1)).\u000aNow Barney needs to pack a backpack and so he wants to know more about his upcoming journey: for every city i, Barney wants to know the expected value of starting_time[i]. He's a friend of Jon Snow and knows nothing, that's why he asked for your help.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains a single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009105) \u2014 the number of cities in USC.\u000aThe second line contains n\u2009-\u20091 integers p2,\u2009p3,\u2009...,\u2009pn (1\u2009\u2264\u2009pi\u2009<\u2009i), where pi is the number of the parent city of city number i in the tree, meaning there is a road between cities numbered pi and i in USC.\u000aOutput\u000aIn the first and only line of output print n numbers, where i-th number is the expected value of starting_time[i].\u000aYour answer for each city will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\u2009-\u20096.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a7\u000a1 2 1 1 4 4\u000aoutput\u000a1.0 4.0 5.0 3.5 4.5 5.0 5.0 \u000ainput\u000a12\u000a1 1 2 2 4 4 3 3 1 10 8\u000aoutput\u000a1.0 5.0 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.0 8.0 7.0 7.5 6.5 7.5 8.0
