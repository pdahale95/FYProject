VC. Pythagorean Triples\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aKatya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.\u000aFor example, triples (3,\u20094,\u20095), (5,\u200912,\u200913) and (6,\u20098,\u200910) are Pythagorean triples.\u000aHere Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.\u000aKatya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?\u000aInput\u000aThe only line of the input contains single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009109) \u2014 the length of some side of a right triangle.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint two integers m and k (1\u2009\u2264\u2009m,\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u20091018), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.\u000aIn case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print \u2009-\u20091 in the only line.
