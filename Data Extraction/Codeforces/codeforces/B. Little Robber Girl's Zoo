VB. Little Robber Girl's Zoo\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aLittle Robber Girl likes to scare animals in her zoo for fun. She decided to arrange the animals in a row in the order of non-decreasing height. However, the animals were so scared that they couldn't stay in the right places.\u000aThe robber girl was angry at first, but then she decided to arrange the animals herself. She repeatedly names numbers l and r such that r\u2009-\u2009l\u2009+\u20091 is even. After that animals that occupy positions between l and r inclusively are rearranged as follows: the animal at position l swaps places with the animal at position l\u2009+\u20091, the animal l\u2009+\u20092 swaps with the animal l\u2009+\u20093, ..., finally, the animal at position r\u2009-\u20091 swaps with the animal r.\u000aHelp the robber girl to arrange the animals in the order of non-decreasing height. You should name at most 20\u2009000 segments, since otherwise the robber girl will become bored and will start scaring the animals again.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line contains a single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 number of animals in the robber girl's zoo.\u000aThe second line contains n space-separated integers a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai\u2009\u2264\u2009109), where ai is the height of the animal occupying the i-th place.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint the sequence of operations that will rearrange the animals by non-decreasing height.\u000aThe output should contain several lines, i-th of the lines should contain two space-separated integers li and ri (1\u2009\u2264\u2009li\u2009<\u2009ri\u2009\u2264\u2009n) \u2014 descriptions of segments the robber girl should name. The segments should be described in the order the operations are performed.\u000aThe number of operations should not exceed 20\u2009000.\u000aIf the animals are arranged correctly from the start, you are allowed to output nothing.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a4\u000a2 1 4 3\u000aoutput\u000a1 4\u000ainput\u000a7\u000a36 28 57 39 66 69 68\u000aoutput\u000a1 4\u000a6 7\u000ainput\u000a5\u000a1 2 1 2 1\u000aoutput\u000a2 5\u000a3 4\u000a1 4\u000a1 4\u000aNote\u000aNote that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
