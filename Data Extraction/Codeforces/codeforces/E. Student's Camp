Camp building can be represented as the rectangle of n\u2009+\u20092 concrete blocks height and m blocks width.\u000aEvery day there is a breeze blowing from the sea. Each block, except for the blocks of the upper and lower levers, such that there is no block to the left of it is destroyed with the probability . Similarly, each night the breeze blows in the direction to the sea. Thus, each block (again, except for the blocks of the upper and lower levers) such that there is no block to the right of it is destroyed with the same probability p. Note, that blocks of the upper and lower level are indestructible, so there are only n·m blocks that can be destroyed.\u000aThe period of the strong winds will last for k days and k nights. If during this period the building will split in at least two connected components, it will collapse and Alex will have to find another place to spend summer.\u000aFind the probability that Alex won't have to look for other opportunities and will be able to spend the summer in this camp.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u20091500) that define the size of the destructible part of building.\u000aThe second line of the input contains two integers a and b (1\u2009\u2264\u2009a\u2009\u2264\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u2009109) that define the probability p.
