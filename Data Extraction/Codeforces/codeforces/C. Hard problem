VC. Hard problem\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aVasiliy is fond of solving different tasks. Today he found one he wasn't able to solve himself, so he asks you to help.\u000aVasiliy is given n strings consisting of lowercase English letters. He wants them to be sorted in lexicographical order (as in the dictionary), but he is not allowed to swap any of them. The only operation he is allowed to do is to reverse any of them (first character becomes last, second becomes one before last and so on).\u000aTo reverse the i-th string Vasiliy has to spent ci units of energy. He is interested in the minimum amount of energy he has to spent in order to have strings sorted in lexicographical order.\u000aString A is lexicographically smaller than string B if it is shorter than B (|A|\u2009<\u2009|B|) and is its prefix, or if none of them is a prefix of the other and at the first position where they differ character in A is smaller than the character in B.\u000aFor the purpose of this problem, two equal strings nearby do not break the condition of sequence being sorted lexicographically.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of strings.\u000aThe second line contains n integers ci (0\u2009\u2264\u2009ci\u2009\u2264\u2009109), the i-th of them is equal to the amount of energy Vasiliy has to spent in order to reverse the i-th string.\u000aThen follow n lines, each containing a string consisting of lowercase English letters. The total length of these strings doesn't exceed 100\u2009000.\u000aOutput\u000aIf it is impossible to reverse some of the strings such that they will be located in lexicographical order, print \u2009-\u20091. Otherwise, print the minimum total amount of energy Vasiliy has to spent.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a2\u000a1 2\u000aba\u000aac\u000aoutput\u000a1\u000ainput\u000a3\u000a1 3 1\u000aaa\u000aba\u000aac\u000aoutput\u000a1\u000ainput\u000a2\u000a5 5\u000abbb\u000aaaa\u000aoutput\u000a-1\u000ainput\u000a2\u000a3 3\u000aaaa\u000aaa\u000aoutput\u000a-1\u000aNote\u000aIn the second sample one has to reverse string 2 or string 3. To amount of energy required to reverse the string 3 is smaller.\u000aIn the third sample, both strings do not change after reverse and they go in the wrong order, so the answer is \u2009-\u20091.\u000aIn the fourth sample, both strings consists of characters 'a' only, but in the sorted order string "aa" should go before string "aaa", thus the answer is \u2009-\u20091.
