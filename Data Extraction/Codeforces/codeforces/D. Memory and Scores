VD. Memory and Scores\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test512 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aMemory and his friend Lexa are competing to get higher score in one popular computer game. Memory starts with score a and Lexa starts with score b. In a single turn, both Memory and Lexa get some integer in the range [\u2009-\u2009k;k] (i.e. one integer among \u2009-\u2009k,\u2009\u2009-\u2009k\u2009+\u20091,\u2009\u2009-\u2009k\u2009+\u20092,\u2009...,\u2009\u2009-\u20092,\u2009\u2009-\u20091,\u20090,\u20091,\u20092,\u2009...,\u2009k\u2009-\u20091,\u2009k) and add them to their current scores. The game has exactly t turns. Memory and Lexa, however, are not good at this game, so they both always get a random integer at their turn.\u000aMemory wonders how many possible games exist such that he ends with a strictly higher score than Lexa. Two games are considered to be different if in at least one turn at least one player gets different score. There are (2k\u2009+\u20091)2t games in total. Since the answer can be very large, you should print it modulo 109\u2009+\u20097. Please solve this problem for Memory.\u000aInput\u000aThe first and only line of input contains the four integers a, b, k, and t (1\u2009\u2264\u2009a,\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u2009100, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u20091000, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009t\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the amount Memory and Lexa start with, the number k, and the number of turns respectively.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint the number of possible games satisfying the conditions modulo 1\u2009000\u2009000\u2009007 (109\u2009+\u20097) in one line.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a1 2 2 1\u000aoutput\u000a6\u000ainput\u000a1 1 1 2\u000aoutput\u000a31\u000ainput\u000a2 12 3 1\u000aoutput\u000a0\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample test, Memory starts with 1 and Lexa starts with 2.
