VE. Runaway to a Shadow\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aDima is living in a dormitory, as well as some cockroaches.\u000aAt the moment 0 Dima saw a cockroach running on a table and decided to kill it. Dima needs exactly T seconds for aiming, and after that he will precisely strike the cockroach and finish it.\u000aTo survive the cockroach has to run into a shadow, cast by round plates standing on the table, in T seconds. Shadow casted by any of the plates has the shape of a circle. Shadow circles may intersect, nest or overlap arbitrarily.\u000aThe cockroach uses the following strategy: first he equiprobably picks a direction to run towards and then runs towards it with the constant speed v. If at some moment t\u2009\u2264\u2009T it reaches any shadow circle, it immediately stops in the shadow and thus will stay alive. Otherwise the cockroach is killed by the Dima's precise strike.
