As known, little bears loves spending their free time playing dice for chocolates. Once in a wonderful sunny morning, walking around blocks of ice, Mishka met her friend Chris, and they started playing the game.\u000aRules of the game are very simple: at first number of rounds n is defined. In every round each of the players throws a cubical dice with distinct numbers from 1 to 6 written on its faces. Player, whose value after throwing the dice is greater, wins the round. In case if player dice values are equal, no one of them is a winner.\u000aIn average, player, who won most of the rounds, is the winner of the game. In case if two players won the same number of rounds, the result of the game is draw.\u000aMishka is still very little and can't count wins and losses, so she asked you to watch their game and determine its result.
