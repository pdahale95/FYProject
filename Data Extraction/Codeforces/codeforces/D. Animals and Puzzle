VD. Animals and Puzzle\u000atime limit per test5 seconds\u000amemory limit per test512 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aOwl Sonya gave a huge lake puzzle of size n\u2009×\u2009m to hedgehog Filya as a birthday present. Friends immediately started to assemble the puzzle, but some parts of it turned out to be empty \u2014 there was no picture on them. Parts with picture on it are denoted by 1, while empty parts are denoted by 0. Rows of the puzzle are numbered from top to bottom with integers from 1 to n, while columns are numbered from left to right with integers from 1 to m.\u000aAnimals decided to complete the picture and play with it, as it might be even more fun! Owl and hedgehog ask each other some queries. Each query is provided by four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 which define the rectangle, where (x1,\u2009y1) stands for the coordinates of the up left cell of the rectangle, while (x2,\u2009y2) stands for the coordinates of the bottom right cell.
