VB. Alyona and Mex\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aSomeone gave Alyona an array containing n positive integers a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an. In one operation, Alyona can choose any element of the array and decrease it, i.e. replace with any positive integer that is smaller than the current one. Alyona can repeat this operation as many times as she wants. In particular, she may not apply any operation to the array at all.\u000aFormally, after applying some operations Alyona will get an array of n positive integers b1,\u2009b2,\u2009...,\u2009bn such that 1\u2009\u2264\u2009bi\u2009\u2264\u2009ai for every 1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009\u2264\u2009n. Your task is to determine the maximum possible value of mex of this array.\u000aMex of an array in this problem is the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in this array. For example, mex of the array containing 1, 3 and 4 is equal to 2, while mex of the array containing 2, 3 and 2 is equal to 1.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of elements in the Alyona's array.\u000aThe second line of the input contains n integers a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai\u2009\u2264\u2009109) \u2014 the elements of the array.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint one positive integer \u2014 the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a5\u000a1 3 3 3 6\u000aoutput\u000a5\u000ainput\u000a2\u000a2 1\u000aoutput\u000a3\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample case if one will decrease the second element value to 2 and the fifth element value to 4 then the mex value of resulting array 1 2 3 3 4 will be equal to 5.\u000aTo reach the answer to the second sample case one must not decrease any of the array elements.
