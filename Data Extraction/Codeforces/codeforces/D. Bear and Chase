VD. Bear and Chase\u000atime limit per test7 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aBearland has n cities, numbered 1 through n. There are m bidirectional roads. The i-th road connects two distinct cities ai and bi. No two roads connect the same pair of cities. It's possible to get from any city to any other city (using one or more roads).\u000aThe distance between cities a and b is defined as the minimum number of roads used to travel between a and b.\u000aLimak is a grizzly bear. He is a criminal and your task is to catch him, or at least to try to catch him. You have only two days (today and tomorrow) and after that Limak is going to hide forever.\u000aYour main weapon is BCD (Bear Criminal Detector). Where you are in some city, you can use BCD and it tells you the distance between you and a city where Limak currently is. Unfortunately, BCD can be used only once a day.\u000aYou don't know much about Limak's current location. You assume that he is in one of n cities, chosen uniformly at random (each city with probability ). You decided for the following plan:\u000aChoose one city and use BCD there.\u000aAfter using BCD you can try to catch Limak (but maybe it isn't a good idea). In this case you choose one city and check it. You win if Limak is there. Otherwise, Limak becomes more careful and you will never catch him (you loose).\u000aWait 24 hours to use BCD again. You know that Limak will change his location during that time. In detail, he will choose uniformly at random one of roads from his initial city, and he will use the chosen road, going to some other city.\u000aTomorrow, you will again choose one city and use BCD there.\u000aFinally, you will try to catch Limak. You will choose one city and check it. You will win if Limak is there, and loose otherwise.\u000aEach time when you choose one of cities, you can choose any of n cities. Let's say it isn't a problem for you to quickly get somewhere.\u000aWhat is the probability of finding Limak, if you behave optimally?\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009400, ) \u2014 the number of cities and the number of roads, respectively.\u000aThen, m lines follow. The i-th of them contains two integers ai and bi (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai,\u2009bi\u2009\u2264\u2009n, ai\u2009\u2260\u2009bi) \u2014 cities connected by the i-th road.\u000aNo two roads connect the same pair of cities. It's possible to get from any city to any other city.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint one real number \u2014 the probability of finding Limak, if you behave optimally. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed 10\u2009-\u20096.\u000aNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if |a\u2009-\u2009b|\u2009\u2264\u200910\u2009-\u20096.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a3 3\u000a1 2\u000a1 3\u000a2 3\u000aoutput\u000a0.833333333333\u000ainput\u000a5 4\u000a1 2\u000a3 1\u000a5 1\u000a1 4\u000aoutput\u000a1.000000000000\u000ainput\u000a4 4\u000a1 2\u000a1 3\u000a2 3\u000a1 4\u000aoutput\u000a0.916666666667\u000ainput\u000a5 5\u000a1 2\u000a2 3\u000a3 4\u000a4 5\u000a1 5\u000aoutput\u000a0.900000000000\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample test, there are three cities and there is a road between every pair of cities. Let's analyze one of optimal scenarios.\u000aUse BCD in city 1.\u000aWith probability Limak is in this city and BCD tells you that the distance is 0. You should try to catch him now and you win for sure.\u000aWith probability the distance is 1 because Limak is in city 2 or city 3. In this case you should wait for the second day.\u000aYou wait and Limak moves to some other city.\u000aThere is probability that Limak was in city 2 and then went to city 3.\u000athat he went from 2 to 1.\u000athat he went from 3 to 2.\u000athat he went from 3 to 1.\u000aUse BCD again in city 1 (though it's allowed to use it in some other city).\u000aIf the distance is 0 then you're sure Limak is in this city (you win).\u000aIf the distance is 1 then Limak is in city 2 or city 3. Then you should guess that he is in city 2 (guessing city 3 would be fine too).\u000aYou loose only if Limak was in city 2 first and then he moved to city 3. The probability of loosing is .
