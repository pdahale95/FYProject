Each line contains some space-separated words, consisting of lowercase English letters.\u000aWe define a syllable as a string that contains exactly one vowel and any arbitrary number (possibly none) of consonants. In English alphabet following letters are considered to be vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y'.\u000aEach word of the text that contains at least one vowel can be divided into syllables. Each character should be a part of exactly one syllable. For example, the word "mamma" can be divided into syllables as "ma" and "mma", "mam" and "ma", and "mamm" and "a". Words that consist of only consonants should be ignored.\u000aThe verse patterns for the given text is a sequence of n integers p1,\u2009p2,\u2009...,\u2009pn. Text matches the given verse pattern if for each i from 1 to n one can divide words of the i-th line in syllables in such a way that the total number of syllables is equal to pi.\u000aYou are given the text and the verse pattern.

Text consists of lowercase English letters and spaces. It's guaranteed that all lines are non-empty, each line starts and ends with a letter and words are separated by exactly one space. The length of each line doesn't exceed 100 characters.\u000aOutput\u000aIf the given text matches the given verse pattern, then print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the output.
