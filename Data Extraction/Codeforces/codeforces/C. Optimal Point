Optimal Point\u000atime limit per test3 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aWhen the river brought Gerda to the house of the Old Lady who Knew Magic, this lady decided to make Gerda her daughter. She wants Gerda to forget about Kay, so she puts all the roses from the garden underground.\u000aMole, who lives in this garden, now can watch the roses without going up to the surface. Typical mole is blind, but this mole was granted as special vision by the Old Lady. He can watch any underground objects on any distance, even through the obstacles and other objects. However, the quality of the picture depends on the Manhattan distance to object being observed.\u000aMole wants to find an optimal point to watch roses, that is such point with integer coordinates that the maximum Manhattan distance to the rose is minimum possible.\u000aAs usual, he asks you to help.\u000aManhattan distance between points (x1,\u2009 y1,\u2009 z1) and (x2,\u2009 y2,\u2009 z2) is defined as |x1\u2009-\u2009x2|\u2009+\u2009|y1\u2009-\u2009y2|\u2009+\u2009|z1\u2009-\u2009z2|.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains an integer t t (1\u2009\u2264\u2009t\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then follow exactly t blocks, each containing the description of exactly one test.\u000aThe first line of each block contains an integer ni (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ni\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of roses in the test. Then follow ni lines, containing three integers each \u2014 the coordinates of the corresponding rose. Note that two or more roses may share the same position.\u000aIt's guaranteed that the sum of all ni doesn't exceed 100\u2009000 and all coordinates are not greater than 1018 by their absolute value.\u000aOutput\u000aFor each of t test cases print three integers \u2014 the coordinates of the optimal point to watch roses. If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\u000aThe coordinates of the optimal point may coincide with the coordinates of any rose.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a1\u000a5\u000a0 0 4\u000a0 0 -4\u000a0 4 0\u000a4 0 0\u000a1 1 1\u000aoutput\u000a0 0 0\u000ainput\u000a2\u000a1\u000a3 5 9\u000a2\u000a3 5 9\u000a3 5 9\u000aoutput\u000a3 5 9\u000a3 5 9\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample, the maximum Manhattan distance from the point to the rose is equal to 4.\u000aIn the second sample, the maximum possible distance is 0.
