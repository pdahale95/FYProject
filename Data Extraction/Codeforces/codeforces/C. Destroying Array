VC. Destroying Array\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aYou are given an array consisting of n non-negative integers a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009an.\u000aYou are going to destroy integers in the array one by one. Thus, you are given the permutation of integers from 1 to n defining the order elements of the array are destroyed.\u000aAfter each element is destroyed you have to find out the segment of the array, such that it contains no destroyed elements and the sum of its elements is maximum possible.
