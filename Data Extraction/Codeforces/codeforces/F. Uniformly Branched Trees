aVA tree is a connected graph without cycles.

aVTwo trees, consisting of n vertices each, are called isomorphic if there exists a permutation p:\u2009{1,\u2009...,\u2009n}\u2009\u2192\u2009{1,\u2009...,\u2009n} such that the edge (u,\u2009v) is present in the first tree if and only if the edge (pu,\u2009pv) is present in the second tree.
