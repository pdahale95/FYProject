VB. Bear and Tower of Cubes\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aLimak is a little polar bear. He plays by building towers from blocks. Every block is a cube with positive integer length of side. Limak has infinitely many blocks of each side length.\u000aA block with side a has volume a3. A tower consisting of blocks with sides a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009ak has the total volume a13\u2009+\u2009a23\u2009+\u2009...\u2009+\u2009ak3.\u000aLimak is going to build a tower. First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer X \u2014 the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed X.\u000aLimak asks you to choose X not greater than m. Also, he wants to maximize the number of blocks in the tower at the end (however, he still behaves greedily). Secondarily, he wants to maximize X.\u000aCan you help Limak? Find the maximum number of blocks his tower can have and the maximum X\u2009\u2264\u2009m that results this number of blocks.\u000aInput\u000aThe only line of the input contains one integer m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u20091015), meaning that Limak wants you to choose X between 1 and m, inclusive.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint two integers \u2014 the maximum number of blocks in the tower and the maximum required total volume X, resulting in the maximum number of blocks.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a48\u000aoutput\u000a9 42\u000ainput\u000a6\u000aoutput\u000a6 6\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample test, there will be 9 blocks if you choose X\u2009=\u200923 or X\u2009=\u200942. Limak wants to maximize X secondarily so you should choose 42.\u000aIn more detail, after choosing X\u2009=\u200942 the process of building a tower is:\u000aLimak takes a block with side 3 because it's the biggest block with volume not greater than 42. The remaining volume is 42\u2009-\u200927\u2009=\u200915.\u000aThe second added block has side 2, so the remaining volume is 15\u2009-\u20098\u2009=\u20097.\u000aFinally, Limak adds 7 blocks with side 1, one by one.\u000aSo, there are 9 blocks in the tower. The total volume is is 33\u2009+\u200923\u2009+\u20097·13\u2009=\u200927\u2009+\u20098\u2009+\u20097\u2009=\u200942.
