VB. Remainders Game\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aToday Pari and Arya are playing a game called Remainders.\u000aPari chooses two positive integer x and k, and tells Arya k but not x. Arya have to find the value . There are n ancient numbers c1,\u2009c2,\u2009...,\u2009cn and Pari has to tell Arya if Arya wants. Given k and the ancient values, tell us if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of x or not. Formally, is it true that Arya can understand the value for any positive integer x?\u000aNote, that means the remainder of x after dividing it by y.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009 k\u2009\u2264\u20091\u2009000\u2009000) \u2014 the number of ancient integers and value k that is chosen by Pari.\u000aThe second line contains n integers c1,\u2009c2,\u2009...,\u2009cn (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ci\u2009\u2264\u20091\u2009000\u2009000).\u000aOutput\u000aPrint "Yes" (without quotes) if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of x, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a4 5\u000a2 3 5 12\u000aoutput\u000aYes\u000ainput\u000a2 7\u000a2 3\u000aoutput\u000aNo\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample, Arya can understand because 5 is one of the ancient numbers.\u000aIn the second sample, Arya can't be sure what is. For example 1 and 7 have the same remainders after dividing by 2 and 3, but they differ in remainders after dividing by 7.
