Zombies gathering outside, forming groups, preparing their assault? This must not happen! Quickly, she fetches her HC2 (Handbook of Crazy Constructions) and looks for the right chapter:\u000aHow to build a wall:\u000aTake a set of bricks.\u000aSelect one of the possible wall designs.

But Heidi is a Coding Cow, not a Constructing Cow. Her mind keeps coming back to point 2b. Despite the imminent danger of a zombie onslaught, she wonders just how many possible walls she could build with up to n bricks.\u000aA wall is a set of wall segments as defined in the easy version. How many different walls can be constructed such that the wall consists of at least 1 and at most n bricks? Two walls are different if there exist a column c and a row r such that one wall has a brick in this spot, and the other does not.\u000aAlong with n, you will be given C, the width of the wall (as defined in the easy version).
