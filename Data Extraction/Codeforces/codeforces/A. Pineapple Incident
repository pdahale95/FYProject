VA. Pineapple Incident\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aTed has a pineapple. This pineapple is able to bark like a bulldog! At time t (in seconds) it barks for the first time. Then every s seconds after it, it barks twice with 1 second interval. Thus it barks at times t, t\u2009+\u2009s, t\u2009+\u2009s\u2009+\u20091, t\u2009+\u20092s, t\u2009+\u20092s\u2009+\u20091, etc.\u000aBarney woke up in the morning and wants to eat the pineapple, but he can't eat it when it's barking. Barney plans to eat it at time x (in seconds), so he asked you to tell him if it's gonna bark at that time.\u000aInput\u000aThe first and only line of input contains three integers t, s and x (0\u2009\u2264\u2009t,\u2009x\u2009\u2264\u2009109, 2\u2009\u2264\u2009s\u2009\u2264\u2009109) \u2014 the time the pineapple barks for the first time, the pineapple barking interval, and the time Barney wants to eat the pineapple respectively.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint a single "YES" (without quotes) if the pineapple will bark at time x or a single "NO" (without quotes) otherwise in the only line of output.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a3 10 4\u000aoutput\u000aNO\u000ainput\u000a3 10 3\u000aoutput\u000aYES\u000ainput\u000a3 8 51\u000aoutput\u000aYES\u000ainput\u000a3 8 52\u000aoutput\u000aYES\u000aNote\u000aIn the first and the second sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 13, 14, ..., so it won't bark at the moment 4 and will bark at the moment 3.\u000aIn the third and fourth sample cases pineapple will bark at moments 3, 11, 12, 19, 20, 27, 28, 35, 36, 43, 44, 51, 52, 59, ..., so it will bark at both moments 51 and 52.
