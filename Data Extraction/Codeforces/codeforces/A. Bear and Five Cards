He has five cards. There is one number written on each card. Each number is a positive integer.\u000aLimak can discard (throw out) some cards. His goal is to minimize the sum of numbers written on remaining (not discarded) cards.\u000aHe is allowed to at most once discard two or three cards with the same number. Of course, he won't discard cards if it's impossible to choose two or three cards with the same number.\u000aGiven five numbers written on cards, cay you find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining cards?\u000aInput\u000aThe only line of the input contains five integers t1, t2, t3, t4 and t5 (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ti\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 numbers written on cards.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint the minimum possible sum of numbers written on remaining cards.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a7 3 7 3 20\u000aoutput\u000a26\u000ainput\u000a7 9 3 1 8\u000aoutput\u000a28\u000ainput\u000a10 10 10 10 10\u000aoutput\u000a20\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample, Limak has cards with numbers 7, 3, 7, 3 and 20.
