PLEASE\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aAs we all know Barney's job is "PLEASE" and he has not much to do at work. That's why he started playing "cups and key". In this game there are three identical cups arranged in a line from left to right. Initially key to Barney's heart is under the middle cup.\u000aThen at one turn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal probability), so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts n turns and Barney independently choses a cup to swap with the middle one within each turn, and the key always remains in the cup it was at the start.\u000aAfter n-th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup contains the key. The girl points to the middle one but Barney was distracted while making turns and doesn't know if the key is under the middle cup. That's why he asked you to tell him the probability that girl guessed right.\u000aNumber n of game turns can be extremely large, that's why Barney did not give it to you. Instead he gave you an array a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009ak such that\u000ain other words, n is multiplication of all elements of the given array.\u000aBecause of precision difficulties, Barney asked you to tell him the answer as an irreducible fraction. In other words you need to find it as a fraction p\u2009/\u2009q such that , where is the greatest common divisor. Since p and q can be extremely large, you only need to find the remainders of dividing each of them by 109\u2009+\u20097.\u000aPlease note that we want of p and q to be 1, not of their remainders after dividing by 109\u2009+\u20097.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of input contains a single integer k (1\u2009\u2264\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u2009105) \u2014 the number of elements in array Barney gave you.\u000aThe second line contains k integers a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009ak (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai\u2009\u2264\u20091018) \u2014 the elements of the array.\u000aOutput\u000aIn the only line of output print a single string x\u2009/\u2009y where x is the remainder of dividing p by 109\u2009+\u20097 and y is the remainder of dividing q by 109\u2009+\u20097.\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a1\u000a2\u000aoutput\u000a1/2\u000ainput\u000a3\u000a1 1 1\u000aoutput\u000a0/1
