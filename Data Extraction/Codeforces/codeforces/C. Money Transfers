VC. Money Transfers\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aThere are n banks in the city where Vasya lives, they are located in a circle, such that any two banks are neighbouring if their indices differ by no more than 1. Also, bank 1 and bank n are neighbours if n\u2009>\u20091. No bank is a neighbour of itself.\u000aVasya has an account in each bank. Its balance may be negative, meaning Vasya owes some money to this bank.\u000aThere is only one type of operations available: transfer some amount of money from any bank to account in any neighbouring bank. There are no restrictions on the size of the sum being transferred or balance requirements to perform this operation.\u000aVasya doesn't like to deal with large numbers, so he asks you to determine the minimum number of operations required to change the balance of each bank account to zero. It's guaranteed, that this is possible to achieve, that is, the total balance of Vasya in all banks is equal to zero.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009100\u2009000) \u2014 the number of banks.\u000aThe second line contains n integers ai (\u2009-\u2009109\u2009\u2264\u2009ai\u2009\u2264\u2009109), the i-th of them is equal to the initial balance of the account in the i-th bank.
