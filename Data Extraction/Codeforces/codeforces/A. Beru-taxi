Beru-taxi\u000atime limit per test1 second\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aVasiliy lives at point (a,\u2009b) of the coordinate plane. He is hurrying up to work so he wants to get out of his house as soon as possible. New app suggested n available Beru-taxi nearby. The i-th taxi is located at point (xi,\u2009yi) and moves with a speed vi.\u000aConsider that each of n drivers will move directly to Vasiliy and with a maximum possible speed. Compute the minimum time when Vasiliy will get in any of Beru-taxi cars.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains two integers a and b (\u2009-\u2009100\u2009\u2264\u2009a,\u2009b\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 coordinates of Vasiliy's home.\u000aThe second line contains a single integer n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u20091000) \u2014 the number of available Beru-taxi cars nearby.\u000aThe i-th of the following n lines contains three integers xi, yi and vi (\u2009-\u2009100\u2009\u2264\u2009xi,\u2009yi\u2009\u2264\u2009100, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009vi\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th car and its speed.\u000aIt's allowed that several cars are located at the same point. Also, cars may be located at exactly the same point where Vasiliy lives.\u000aOutput\u000aPrint a single real value \u2014 the minimum time Vasiliy needs to get in any of the Beru-taxi cars. You answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\u2009-\u20096.\u000aNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if .\u000aExamples\u000ainput\u000a0 0\u000a2\u000a2 0 1\u000a0 2 2\u000aoutput\u000a1.00000000000000000000\u000ainput\u000a1 3\u000a3\u000a3 3 2\u000a-2 3 6\u000a-2 7 10\u000aoutput\u000a0.50000000000000000000\u000aNote\u000aIn the first sample, first taxi will get to Vasiliy in time 2, and second will do this in time 1, therefore 1 is the answer.\u000aIn the second sample, cars 2 and 3 will arrive simultaneously.
