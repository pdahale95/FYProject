VB. Bakery\u000atime limit per test2 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aMasha wants to open her own bakery and bake muffins in one of the n cities numbered from 1 to n. There are m bidirectional roads, each of whose connects some pair of cities.\u000aTo bake muffins in her bakery, Masha needs to establish flour supply from some storage. There are only k storages, located in different cities numbered a1,\u2009a2,\u2009...,\u2009ak.\u000aUnforunately the law of the country Masha lives in prohibits opening bakery in any of the cities which has storage located in it. She can open it only in one of another n\u2009-\u2009k cities, and, of course, flour delivery should be paid \u2014 for every kilometer of path between storage and bakery Masha should pay 1 ruble.\u000aFormally, Masha will pay x roubles, if she will open the bakery in some city b (ai\u2009\u2260\u2009b for every 1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009\u2264\u2009k) and choose a storage in some city s (s\u2009=\u2009aj for some 1\u2009\u2264\u2009j\u2009\u2264\u2009k) and b and s are connected by some path of roads of summary length x (if there are more than one path, Masha is able to choose which of them should be used).\u000aMasha is very thrifty and rational. She is interested in a city, where she can open her bakery (and choose one of k storages and one of the paths between city with bakery and city with storage) and pay minimum possible amount of rubles for flour delivery. Please help Masha find this amount.\u000aInput\u000aThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u2009105, 0\u2009\u2264\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u2009n) \u2014 the number of cities in country Masha lives in, the number of roads between them and the number of flour storages respectively.\u000aThen m lines follow.
