Dividing Kingdom II\u000atime limit per test6 seconds\u000amemory limit per test256 megabytes\u000ainputstandard input\u000aoutputstandard output\u000aLong time ago, there was a great kingdom and it was being ruled by The Great Arya and Pari The Great. These two had some problems about the numbers they like, so they decided to divide the great kingdom between themselves.\u000aThe great kingdom consisted of n cities numbered from 1 to n and m bidirectional roads between these cities, numbered from 1 to m. The i-th road had length equal to wi. The Great Arya and Pari The Great were discussing about destructing some prefix (all road with numbers less than some x) and suffix (all roads with numbers greater than some x) of the roads so there will remain only the roads with numbers l,\u2009l\u2009+\u20091,\u2009...,\u2009r\u2009-\u20091 and r.\u000aAfter that they will divide the great kingdom into two pieces (with each city belonging to exactly one piece) such that the hardness of the division is minimized. The hardness of a division is the maximum length of a road such that its both endpoints are in the same piece of the kingdom. In case there is no such road, the hardness of the division is considered to be equal to \u2009-\u20091.\u000aHistorians found the map of the great kingdom, and they have q guesses about the l and r chosen by those great rulers.

aVLong time ago, there was a great kingdom and it was being ruled by The Great Arya and Pari The Great. These two had some problems about the numbers they like, so they decided to divide the great kingdom between themselves.
p27
aVThe great kingdom consisted of n cities numbered from 1 to n and m bidirectional roads between these cities, numbered from 1 to m. The i-th road had length equal to wi. The Great Arya and Pari The Great were discussing about destructing some prefix (all road with numbers less than some x) and suffix (all roads with numbers greater than some x) of the roads so there will remain only the roads with numbers l,\u2009l\u2009+\u20091,\u2009...,\u2009r\u2009-\u20091 and r.
p28
aVAfter that they will divide the great kingdom into two pieces (with each city belonging to exactly one piece) such that the hardness of the division is minimized. The hardness of a division is the maximum length of a road such that its both endpoints are in the same piece of the kingdom. In case there is no such road, the hardness of the division is considered to be equal to \u2009-\u20091.
p29
aVHistorians found the map of the great kingdom, and they have q guesses about the l and r chosen by those great rulers. Given these data, for each guess li and ri print the minimum possible hardness of the division of the kingdom.
