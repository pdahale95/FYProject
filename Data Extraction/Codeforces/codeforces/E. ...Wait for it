aVBarney is searching for his dream girl. He lives in NYC. NYC has n junctions numbered from 1 to n and n\u2009-\u20091 roads connecting them. We will consider the NYC as a rooted tree with root being junction 1. m girls live in NYC, i-th of them lives along junction ci and her weight initially equals i pounds.
p27
aVBarney consider a girl x to be better than a girl y if and only if: girl x has weight strictly less than girl y or girl x and girl y have equal weights and index of girl x living junction index is strictly less than girl y living junction index, i.e. cx\u2009<\u2009cy. Thus for any two girls one of them is always better than another one.

aVBarney goes from junction v to junction u. As a result he picks at most k best girls he still have not invited from junctions on his way and invites them to his house to test if one of them is his dream girl. If there are less than k not invited girls on his path, he invites all of them.
