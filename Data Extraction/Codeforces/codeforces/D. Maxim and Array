He immediately come up with idea of changing it: he invented positive integer x and decided to add or subtract it from arbitrary array elements. Formally, by applying single operation Maxim chooses integer i (1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009\u2264\u2009n) and replaces the i-th element of array ai either with ai\u2009+\u2009x or with ai\u2009-\u2009x. Please note that the operation may be applied more than once to the same position.\u000aMaxim is a curious minimalis, thus he wants to know what is the minimum value that the product of all array elements (i.e. ) can reach, if Maxim would apply no more than k operations to it.
