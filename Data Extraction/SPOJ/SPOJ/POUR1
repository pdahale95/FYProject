V Given two vessels, one of which can accommodate a litres of water and the other - b litres of water, determine the number of steps required to obtain exactly c litres of water in one of the vessels. a b c At the beginning both vessels are empty. The following operations are counted as 'steps': emptying a vessel,\u000afilling a vessel,\u000apouring water from one vessel to the other, without spilling, until one of the vessels is either full or empty. emptying a vessel,\u000afilling a vessel,\u000apouring water from one vessel to the other, without spilling, until one of the vessels is either full or empty. emptying a vessel, filling a vessel, pouring water from one vessel to the other, without spilling, until one of the vessels is either full or empty.
