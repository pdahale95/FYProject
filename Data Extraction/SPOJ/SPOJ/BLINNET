V We have discovered the fastest communication medium Bytelandian scientists announced, and they called it blingors. The blingors are incomparably better than other media known before. Many companies in Byteland started to build blingors networks, so the information society in the kingdom of Bytes is fact! The priority is to build the core of the blingors network, joinig main cities in the country. Assume there is some number of cities that will be connected at the beginning. The cost of building blingors connection between two cities depends on many elements, but it has been successfully estimated. Your task is to design the blingors network connections between some cities in this way that between any pair of cities is a communication route. The cost of this network should be as small as possible.
