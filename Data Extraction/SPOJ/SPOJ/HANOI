V Consider the folowing variation of the well know problem Towers of Hanoi: We are given n towers and m disks of sizes 1,2,3,...,m stacked on some towers. Your objective is to transfer all the disks to the k-th tower in as few moves as you can manage, but taking into account the following rules: n m m k moving only one disk at a time,\u000anever moving a larger disk one onto a smaller one,\u000amoving only between towers at distance at most d. moving only one disk at a time, never moving a larger disk one onto a smaller one, moving only between towers at distance at most d. d You can assume that all the problems can be solved in not more than 20000 moves. Input The first line of input contains a single positive integer t <= 1000, the number of test cases. t Each tests case begins with the number of towers 3 <= n <= 100, the number of target tower 1 <= k <= n, the number of disks m <= 100 and the maximum distance 1 <= d <= n - 1.\u000a\u000aThen, the following m lines consists of pairs of numbers describing the initial situation, in the form: the tower and disk on it.
